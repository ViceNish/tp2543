					<!-- about yourself here -->
					Hello there. My name is Muhammad Danish Bin Hairol Nizam. This is the page where I describe about myself in short introduction of my favourite places, my computing skills and favourite pictures. Currently, I studied at UKM enroll Bachelor in Software Engineering (Information System) with Honours.
					<br>
					<br>
					About myself, I'm a type of guy who love to explore new things and once I'm interested in that things, I will keep grinding for that thing. For example, last semester I learnt mobile programming subject and fall in love with it. So I make a lot of project to sharpen my skills. My principal is simple 'if you want to make future easy for you or you want to be lazy in the future, then start giving your effort now !!!'.
					<br>
					<br>
					Finally, I hope those who are reading this may stay healthy and always achieve your dreams. Thank you for your time fellas ! :)
